## Google Ads Search Ads, Shopping Ads, and Performance Max

Google Ads is a powerful tool for businesses looking to increase their online presence and drive sales. However, it can be overwhelming for beginners who are just getting started. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of setting up and optimizing three types of Google Ads campaigns: Search Ads, Shopping Ads, and Performance Max.

**Pre-launch Checklist:** Before launching any Google Ads campaign, there are a few things you need to do to ensure that you're set up for success. Here's a detailed pre-launch checklist:

1. Get Keywords Everywhere and purchase some credits: [https://keywordseverywhere.com/](https://keywordseverywhere.com/)
    
2. Create a Google Ads account
    
3. Create a Google Analytics account and integrate it with Shopify
    
4. Create a Merchant Center account
    
5. Set up the Google Sales Channel on Shopify
    
6. Set up shipping settings on Shopify (we recommend offering free shipping)
    

**A Few Extra Pre-Start Recommendations: In addition to the pre-launch checklist, here are a few extra recommendations to help you get started:**

1. Use Keywords Everywhere and research some keywords for your search campaign. We recommend targeting keywords with a search volume between 1,000 and 20,000 searches per month. Avoid targeting keywords with very high search volumes, as this can quickly deplete your budget.
    
2. Optimize your product titles and descriptions for SEO. Include your target keywords in your titles and descriptions to improve your relevance score and rank higher in search results.
    

**Testing and Scaling (Search Ads):** Once your search campaign is up and running, it's important to continually test and optimize your keywords. Here's what you need to do:

1. Run your initial keywords campaign and turn off anything that spends your break-even point without making a sale.
    
2. Keep cycling new keywords.
    
3. Monitor your search terms. Exclude search terms leaking money and add profitable search terms as new keywords in a new ad group.
    
4. Keep testing and increase the budget on your most profitable keywords, according to ROAS. Keep in mind that you'll reach a plateau after which it will be hard to increase your budget even further since there is a limit on the monthly search volume for each keyword.
    

**Testing and Scaling (Shopping Ads):** Shopping Ads take longer to optimize than search ads, so it's important to be patient and let your ads run for at least 7 days before making any changes. Here's what you need to do:

1. Turn off anything that spends your break-even point without making a sale.
    
2. Only make changes once a week!
    
3. After the first week of spending, increase your bid by 20% on anything profitable and decrease your bid by 20% on anything that is unprofitable in the last 7 days.
    
4. Keep monitoring search terms, and exclude unprofitable search terms that may be leaking money.
    

Performance Max: If you're a beginner looking to start a Google Ads campaign in 2023, we recommend starting with Performance Max. Here's what you need to know:

**Assets:** To start a Performance Max campaign, we recommend that you have the following assets:

* 3 different sized logos of your company
    
* 5 video ads with different formats (mix of vertical and square aspect ratios)
    
* 15 picture ads with different formats (mix of vertical and square aspect ratios)
    

**Campaign Setup:**

If you’re starting with a fresh Google Ads account with no data, I’d recommend you start by optimizing for Conversions as opposed to conversion value.

When setting up your ads, fill in with at least 5 headlines, 5 long headlines, and 5 descriptions. When doing so, try to use as many relevant keywords to your target audience as possible as this will be an important point of intelligence for the machine learning system that guides delivery in a Performance Max campaign.

Make sure to set up an audience signal with as many relevant data points to your target audience as possible, such as demographics, search interests, and general interests.

When doing targeting for a new offer I’d recommend that you start by keeping your target as narrow as possible: start with the best possible pocket of your audience and then expand once you have data, as this will help Google’s machine learning system to optimize based on the data that you gather from existing conversions.

Once you start running your Performance Max campaign, remember to let it run for at least a week before making changes. Performance Max is heavily based on machine learning and making changes too early will compromise the learning phase.

## **Find a Winning Product on TikTok Organically**

**Step 1:** Search for "Tiktok Made Me Buy It" and filter the videos to the most popular/most engaged of the week. This will weed out all of the saturated and old products.

**Step 2:** Click on all the top video products that you notice and see how many views they are getting. Monitor their engagement levels, see if they have a functioning store, and check if they are still uploading consistently and frequently. If they are still posting and have positive engagement, the odds are they are generating sales.

**Step 3:** Look for videos that have hit over 1 million views and under 10 million, as this leaves plenty of room for you to come in. Videos with hundreds of thousands of views are also sweet spots.

**Step 4:** Search for the product niche hashtag on TikTok to see how many views that niche is getting and if it is popular.

**Step 5:** Make sure the niche is getting tens, if not hundreds, of millions of views on multiple videos.

**Step 6:** Search for the product on AliExpress and begin promoting once the profit margins align. Profit margins must be above 40%.

## How to Create Organic Content That Will Go Viral on TikTok

**Step 1:** Replicate your competitor's most viral video.

**Step 2:** Introduce trending sounds and hashtags to your content.

**Step 3:** Ensure that the camera quality is decent. Use TikTok's enhancing effect to make your video appear of higher quality.

**Step 4:** Remake sounds and focuses on creating good, satisfying sounds.

**Step 5:** Keep your videos at a good pace.

**Step 6:** Edit your videos on TikTok, as TikTok pushes out videos edited on their platform.

> Bonus: TikTok is pushing longer videos (15-45 seconds). Horizontal videos are also going to become a thing, so make sure to implement some of those.

## Mistakes to Avoid on TikTok Organically

* Avoid engaging with your account.
    
* Avoid stealing other people's content.
    
* Avoid buying followers.
    
* Avoid being inconsistent.
    

## How to Analyze Your Content/Account

* Your account should be growing.
    
* Views should be at least over 200 in the first 48 hours.
    
* Your followers should be growing.
    
* Like the view, the ratio should be no higher than 1/50.
    
* Your comments should be positive.
    

It takes 2 weeks, sometimes more, of uploading every day to hit the algorithm and go viral. It takes time. Always be consistent and keep testing products out.
