## I am

so excited to announce that we are very close to opening the doors for a new AWS Journey ðŸŽ‰ **#AWSJourney**

I've been working full-time for the last 3 months on this course.

I've realized that creating a good course, that will actually help you get closer to your goals  , is very hard. It required a lot of planning when it comes to the structure of the course, keeping in mind the end product that you will build.

I made sure to cover a very wide set of skills that would help you with the whole process.

## Course Objective ðŸ’ª

You've probably already heard of cloud computing, `aws`, `lambda` functions, `s3` buckets, but maybe have no idea what those things are. Good news! This course serve as an introduction to all of these things and more!

You'll learn how to deploy a `cdk` template, write your first `lambda` function, initialize a new `s3` bucket to store your assets, save things in a NoSQL database called `dynamoDB`, connect a `react` application to your backend and deploy all of it to a CDN!

By the end of the course you'll not only have a good understanding of (some of) `aws` features, you'll also have a working application deployed live on the internet.
