Any software developer worth their salt will tell you that one of the most important things you can do to improve your skills is to read.

But with the vast number of books available on the subject, it can be hard to know where to start.

To help you out, Iâ€™ve compiled a list of essential reads for any software developer.

Note: The list contains only books not related to any particular programming language.

1. Test Driven Development: By Example ( Kent Back )
 Another classic one.

[Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530?crid=2GI4T01NI7QUQ&keywords=Test+Driven+Development:+By+Example+(+Kent+Back+)&qid=1662899151&sprefix=test+driven+development+by+example+kent+back+,aps,216&sr=8-1&linkCode=sl1&tag=klitonbare-20&linkId=e6237ae0b440af30067b9ad0f1fca3cf&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)

I didnâ€™t know a lot about TDD since I discovered it at a Codemotion event.

Iâ€™ve read this book multiple times, and since then, my code quality increased a lot.

Quite simply, test-driven development eliminates fear in application development.
 

In my opinion, this book should be a required read for anyone of any level and position in the software development field.

This book teaches so many timeless and solid principles that could take years for the average developer to learn, if ever, especially if you are a self-taught developer.

2. Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions
