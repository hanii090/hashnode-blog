Read on to learn more!

### Strategy one

*Generate leads by scraping groups:*

Find relevant, active LinkedIn groups. You can do this by using LinkedIn’s basic filters and choosing the group option.

Make sure that the groups have a decent number of members, and participate in conversations for a few days or weeks. Use a scraping tool to scrape members by LinkedIn profile, and use the list of scraped members to run a highly personalized campaign.

You can reach out to people using this template:

Hi {First name},

Hope you’re doing great! My name is X, and my background is in X and X. We’re both members of \[LinkedIn Group\], and I noticed that you had some pretty insightful comments on topic X \[something shared in the group\].

If you’re open to it, can we discuss this topic further? Also, let’s connect. Thanks!

*Our results with this strategy:*

* 70% acceptance rate.
    
* 25% response rate.
    
* Booked 10 demo calls.
    

*What makes this an effective strategy?*

Targeting a LinkedIn group is very effective because these groups often contain niche members with the same interests as you. They are more likely to be your potential clients. When approached carefully and thoughtfully, this growth hack can bring you a stream of new leads.

### Strategy two

*Content retargeting:*

Find a relevant LinkedIn post with a high engagement rate (large number of likes and comments). Copy the URL of the post, and paste it into LinkedCamp.

The tool will scrape the list of those who have liked and commented. Most of these profiles will have similar interests since you're targeting a relevant post. Next, run a highly personalized campaign using a template like this one:

Hi {First name},

Hope you are doing well! I saw your comment on a post related to B2B lead generation. I want to learn more about it, and fill my network with like-minded people like you.

Let’s connect!

*Our results:*

* 70% acceptance rate.
    
* 30% response rate.
    

*Why does this strategy work?*

This technique is useful because people with mutual interests are more likely to convert. You can start a conversation by letting them know that you also like what they like, giving them a good reason to connect with you.

### Strategy three

*Run hyper-personalized campaigns:*

This is the most effective strategy, and we generated a good number of leads using this technique. Before applying it, you need to thoroughly understand hyper-personalization; most people get it wrong.

Many founders just sprinkle first and last names in a message and think that's the extent of it. With LinkedIn automation tools, you can personalize a campaign even further. Using dynamic, personalized tags, custom images, and highly-specific templates, each of your prospects will feel that the message has been crafted for them.

*Our results:*

* 50% responded to our messages.
    
* 300+ leads.
    

*Why does this strategy work?*

Personalization quickly grabs people's attention. They are more likely to respond when you add specific details about them.

Old cut-and-dry templates don’t work because prospects think you haven’t made any effort to connect with them. Not only that, you need to go beyond first and last names and be more personal when approaching your ideal prospects.

It’s also important that it doesn't read as an automated message; it needs to be human!
