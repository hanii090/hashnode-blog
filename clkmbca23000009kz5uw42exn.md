# Frontend

In this article, we will walk you through the process of building an OnlyFans content-sharing application using React Native. Inspired by OnlyFans, this app allows creators to share exclusive content behind a paywall, with users directly supporting them. We will cover both the front-end and back-end aspects of the application, making it accessible for both iOS and Android users. Let's dive into the step-by-step guide!

We'll set up the project using the

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest -e with-router
```

command with the latest version of Expo. You'll learn how to view the app on iOS, Android emulators, or your physical device using the Expo Go app by scanning a QR code.

In the following section, we'll design the home screen, displaying posts and recommended users to follow. We'll start by rendering a single user's information like their background, avatar, name, and handle using dummy data.

### For Posts

Then, we'll style the user card component by adjusting the layout, adding padding, and rendering an image using the React Native image component.

### For User

Next up, we'll focus on the profile page. We'll render the cover image, add a back button, display the account name

***Now we'll create a new post screen. You'll learn how to add text input functionality and implement the select image feature using Expo Image Picker.***

We'll then style the app elements and add icons, making it visually appealing and protecting user content with a paywall.

# Backend

Prerequisites:

1. An AWS account - If you don't have one, you can sign up for a free account on [aws](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/amplify/?sc_channel=el&trk=bc603709-686b-4e27-b79f-07e5de3686ec). @AwsAmplify
    
2. Node.js installed on your machine - You can download it from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org).
    
3. Setting up the Project: Clone the repository: Begin by cloning the project repository from the provided link and switch to the UI branch.
    

[Clone Repository](https://github.com/hanii090/onlyfans-aws-react-native/tree/ui)

1. Install dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies by running
    
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
2. Start the development server: Run `npm start` to start the development server. Connect to React Native application:
    
3. Use the Amplify Pool command to connect the backend to the React Native application.

1. Setting up the Amplify Configuration:
    
    a. Amplify Folder: Explore the Amplify folder, which contains most of the backend code and configuration.
    
2. ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690528416400/9513af1d-1688-42ca-a332-84907713aa53.png align="center")
    
    Implementing Authentication:
    
    Set up Root Layout File: Create a root layout file (e.g., layout.js) using Expo router to wrap all pages and add global providers like React Context.
    
    **Set up Authentication: Use Amplify Studio to set up authentication with options like email login.**
    

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690528595673/158d18c6-18cf-4ef1-bdee-0c0dea70860a.png align="center")

1. Implementing Authentication with Amplify UI Library:
    

Install Required Packages: Install the necessary packages for Amplify UI Library and import the Authenticator component.

```bash
npm install @aws-amplify/ui-react-native react-native-get-random-values react-native-url-polyfill
```

**Import the** `withAuthenticator` Higher-Order Component and `useAuthenticator` hook:

```javascript
import { withAuthenticator, useAuthenticator } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react-native';copy
```

```javascript
<Authenticator.Provider>
      <Authenticator>
        <Stack screenOptions={{ headerShown: false }} />
      </Authenticator>
    </Authenticator.Provider>
```

**Lastly, wrap your** `App` export with the `withAuthenticator` Amplify UI component:

```javascript
export default withAuthenticator(App);
```

> User Account Creation and Authentication Flow: Create User Account:
> 
> Create an account using Amplify UI Library. The user fields like name and nickname are parsed and rendered in the account creation form.
> 
> Multi-Factor Authentication: Receive a confirmation code via email and go through the authentication flow with multi-factor authentication.
> 
> Redirect and Auto Sign-In: After authentication, the user is redirected to the application's home screen and will be remembered for future sign-ins.

1. Setting up the Database and API:
    

> Design Data Models: Define data models for users and posts with required fields like name, handle, bio, avatar, cover image, text, image, and likes.
> 
> ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690529739056/3c877586-73d5-453b-90bd-3839648df485.png align="center")
> 
> Set up Relationships: Set up the one-to-many relationship between users and posts using AWS Amplify.
> 
> ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1690529810137/7464e436-614b-4920-94b8-bff3336866f3.png align="center")
> 
> Save and Deploy Changes: Save the changes and deploy the backend environment, which automatically creates DynamoDB tables for each model.

1. Querying Data from the Database:

> Use DataStore Library:
> 
> Import the DataStore library provided by Amplify and import the user model from the automatically generated models file.
> 
> ```javascript
>   import { DataStore } from 'aws-amplify';
> 
> useEffect(() => {
>     // fetch users
>     DataStore.query(User).then(setUsers);
>   }, []);
> ```
> 
> Query User Data: Use the `datastore.query` method to fetch user data and set the results in the state using the `setUsers` setter.
