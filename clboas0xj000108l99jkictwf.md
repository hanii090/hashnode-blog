**Mistake #1:** Going solo

Blogging is NOT a one-man job.

You can NOT succeed if youâ€™re the ONLY one working on your blog.

Blogging requires a lot of tasks, such as;

*   **Topic research**
    
*   **Content creation**
    
*   **Blog post editing and optimization**
    
*   **Email marketing**
    
*   **Networking with other bloggers regularly**
    
*   **Finding the proper monetization strategies**
    
*   **Regularly analyzing your websiteâ€™s SEO and your competitors**
    
*   **And the list goes on**
    

`You canâ€™t do ALL these tasks alone.`

Itâ€™s OKAY to work hard for the first year (when youâ€™ve no budget to outsource blogging tasks). But once your blog starts generating income, invest all the money back into growing your blog (not on buying your favorite smartphone, bike, car, etc.).

**Mistake #2:** Not being consistent

Are they still blogging? Not even 1% of them!

To succeed in blogging, you must be consistent with your posting schedule. Consistency is key when it comes to running a successful blog.

By regularly publishing new content, you can build a loyal audience and establish your blog as a go-to source for information in your niche.

**Mistake #3:** Ignoring SEO

Search engine optimization (SEO) is the *#1* factor in running a successful blog.

`SEO traffic converts BETTER.`

Here are some key things to consider when it comes to SEO;

*   Use keywords strategically in your blog post titles, headings, and throughout the content of your post.
    
*   Creating 10x better content than your competitors
    
*   Optimizing your images using descriptive file names and alt tags. You can also use a free plugin like Rank Math.
    
*   Building backlinks through guest posts, blog comments, Quora answers, etc.
    
*   Regularly update your blog posts. It's essential to keep your blog up-to-date and free of broken links and outdated information to provide a top-notch experience for your readers.
    

  
By learning from these mistakes and avoiding them, you can build a blog that earns thousands of dollars every month.

To your success.
