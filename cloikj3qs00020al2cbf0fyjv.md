## 1\. PDF GPT – Your Personal PDF Summarizer

Every student knows the pain of dissecting hefty PDF documents for useful information. PDF GPT comes in super handy at such times. This AI tool creates instant summaries, insights, and notes for any PDF. All you have to do is drag and drop the PDF file and let PDF GPT do the rest.

Once it's done analyzing, it'll give you a summary of the PDF. What's impressive is the accuracy of the summaries. It also lets you ask specific questions about the contents of the PDF, which it answers with references from the PDF.

If you're a student or anyone who often grapples with large PDF documents, PDF GPT is an indispensable tool.

## 2\. Parrot AI: Transform Video Meetings into Notes and Insights

We've all been part of lengthy video meetings and often worry about missing or forgetting crucial points. Enter Parrot AI. This tool summarizes your meetings, whether live or recorded, saving you time and possibly money.

By simply sharing the meeting URL or inviting Parrot AI as an attendee, you essentially hire a personal assistant to take notes for you. You can upload the audio file of your meetings and Parrot AI will summarize the whole session for you. You can also find detailed insights by asking questions about the meetings.

However, a word of caution to consider here - avoid sharing confidential meetings and information with this tool.
