#### **Mistake number one:**

🛑 Don't use it like you use Google to search  
✅ Give it context, Ask ChatGPT to take the role you need it to take.

💡 Simply put, Have a conversation with it, and be nice

💬 Example Prompt

"You are a travel booking expert, and I'm on a $2000 budget. I'm living in Copenhagen and want to go somewhere nice and warm in December. Where in the world do you think I could go?"

💬 Example Prompt

"You are a world-famous Michelin-star restaurant chef, the best of the best. Could you please provide me with a simple and easy-to-cook 3-course meal that would impress the president?"

#### **Mistake number two:**

🛑 Asking for the conventional  
✅ Ask it to go against the current

💡 Ask for things that go against the norm, that challenge the recipient, ask it to come up with new angles, and see things with a different lens.

💬 Example Prompt

"Topic: Growing your followers on Twitter

For the above topic, give examples that contradict the dominant narrative. Generate an outline for thought-provoking content that challenges assumptions."

![ ](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/uq8d038t/production/5197b13f886ce72d31740592d074ceb2442bb250-1200x1122.jpg?w=3840&q=75&fit=clip&auto=format align="left")

💬 Example Prompt

"Topic: Parenting a 2.5 year old

For the above topic, give examples that contradict the dominant narrative. Generate an outline for thought-provoking content that challenges assumptions."

![ ](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/uq8d038t/production/3b3199782bd0ca80f70718b26b3a16dcf39fab61-1200x1100.jpg?w=3840&q=75&fit=clip&auto=format align="left")

#### **Mistake number three:**

🛑 Ask for a list of 5 things  
✅ Ask it to come up with new angles, or ideas that are uncommon or novel

💡 Super charge your brainstorming with ChatGPT

💬 Example Prompt

"Topic: How to double my available time.

For the topic above, brainstorm new angles or approaches. Prioritize ideas that are uncommon or novel."

#### **Mistake number four:**

🛑 Use it to respond to your emails  
✅ Teach it your tone of voice, and then respond to emails

💡 Feed GPT with your writing and use NPL to extract a prompt for your style

💬 Example prompt

"You are a classification AI, Using NLP I want you to analyze the text below for style, voice, and tone. Then create a prompt to write a new text in the same style, voice, and tone:

\[Insert your text here\]"

![ ](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/uq8d038t/production/e0dea699db8484099191035420b972237ef73a1a-1200x553.jpg?w=3840&q=75&fit=clip&auto=format align="left")

Once you have your voice and tone use it to write whatever emails you need. And they will be personal and in your tone of voice:

#### **Mistake number five:**

🛑 Just use the standard response
