Picking a **niche** for your blog is hard. Extremely hard!

If you choose the wrong niche, it can’t be undone! You’ll be wasting both your time and money when you’re in the wrong niche.

So how to choose a niche that helps you make money in the long run?

*If you’re planning to start a blog to make a living in the long run, you should definitely consider your passion (or interest, experience, or skills).*

Ask yourself these questions.

* Where are you good at? (which skills do you have)
    
* What interests you?
    
* Is this topic profitable? (do some research and find sites that are earning money in that topic)
    
* Can I blog on the same topic even after 5 years? (or does this topic teaches me something even after a few years)
    

Come up with 5 to 10 niche ideas. Then, find profitability. Check for products. Analyze all the sites that are already successful in that niche. So you can easily filter out unwanted niche ideas.

### Do some keyword research and use metrics

Keyword research is the ultimate way to find a trending (or popular) niche. You can use tools like Semrush to easily come up with a ton of niche ideas. The key here is to use the RIGHT metrics including;

* Search volume
    
* Search trend (you can also use Google Trends to check the trend of a keyword or topic)
    
* CPC (cost per volume, should be as high as possible)
    
* Competition (don’t find a niche with too much competition or zero competition, it should have a decent amount of products and enough searches so you can build a successful site in the long run)
    

### Go narrow

When it comes to niche selection, it’s a smart idea to go narrow. It’s almost impossible to create an authority in the technology niche as you can’t compete with authority sites like Mashable, TechCrunch, and so on.

That’s why you need to select a niche where you can define unmet or underserved needs, create great content in ONE specific topic, and dominate that "small market".

If you try to launch your new blog in a heavily crowded market, you'll face a tough uphill battle against other big websites in that niche. So don’t make that mistake.

Here’s a great illustration that shows you how to easily find the sweet spot in niche selection.

### Make sure to consider;

* Things you love (such as SEO, blogging, YouTube, etc)
    
* Things you’re good at (such as SEO, copywriting, web design, etc)
    
* Things people want (such as keyword research, link building, email marketing, etc)
