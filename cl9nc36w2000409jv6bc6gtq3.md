## **Hey there**

I *mentioned * before that I felt a bit *lost * when I was *starting * out on my programming journey.

> It's true   â€” it was a very  frustrating experience. Maybe you're feeling a little frustrated, too!

I tried several courses and looked into different educational avenues to try and find answers, but most of them only teach theory and **don't provide practical** , *real-world* solutions for new developers.

So there are **two** things I want to share with you.

> First, here's a list of resources I've put together that will provide you with a lot of relief as you continue learning. Oh, and this list is LONG, so be sure to stay tuned for tomorrow for the other major solution that will help you become a master!
