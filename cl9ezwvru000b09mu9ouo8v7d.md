## Hey there!

Have you always wanted to become a** tech startup founder **or build your own** SaaS?**

Or you already have one and are not sure if it will ever be *successful*.

Well… You can decide whether it's going to be successful or not, by avoiding this *#1 rookie mistake 💯*

When you talk about building a *tech startup* or *SaaS* what's the **first thing** that comes to your mind?

Most of the **time**, you start thinking about the product or what you have to offer.

> That's where you fail.

## Yesterday

 I was having a chat with my team and I asked them the question – If I gave you 30 days to prove that your tech *startup/SaaS* is going to be successful, what would you do?

The *answers *that came from the *marketing team* and the software *development team* was completely different.

The software development team's answer was…
 > We would try to find competitor apps, see where we can find create an edge and build an MVP of the app in 30 days.

The marketing team's answer was… 
> We would build a landing page or something and promote it on social media to see if there is an interest among people for the idea.

Both teams were wrong ❌

The correct answer is quite simple and is just 2 words.

> Can you take a guess?

**It's "Paying Customers".**

## If 
If you cannot get a single* paying customer* for your supposed SaaS, then it's never going to be successful because you're never going to generate revenue from the SaaS.

There was this video by   [NoahKagan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz8qWI1ixGs&ab_channel=NoahKagan)– Founder of a *multi-million dollar SaaS* "AppSumo" on building a Million Dollar Startup in 24 Hours.

> In his *video*, the first thing he did was *analyze *the business idea and figure out a business model and the second most important thing he did was get a few paying customers.

It can either be your* friends, colleagues,* or anyone you believe could get value from your **SaaS**.

If you manage to make *$100* in the first week by pitching the idea without actually having the app, then its a matter of time until you build an *MVP* and scale your *SaaS * to $1000/month, $10,000/month, and even $100,000/month 🚀

Let me give you a **challenge** 🔥

  1. Brainstorm 5 SaaS/Startup Ideas by yourself and write it down.

2.   Figure out a business model (way to generate revenue for the business) – It can be a monthly subscription, a one-time fee, or whatever you think suits best.

3.   Pitch it to your friends/family and try to make $100 in the first 7 days before you even start focusing on building the product

4.   If you succeed in making $100, build an MVP and share it with your paying customers. Get feedback from them, and improve.

5.  Launch your startup 🚀

**📝 Note**: Keep in mind that it doesn't have to be **$100**, it can either be **$50** or even **$500** it just depends on how much valuable the product is going to be for a customer.

Looking forward to hearing your SaaS/Startup ideas ❤️

Love your beautiful face,
