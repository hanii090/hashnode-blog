Let's open with good news. If youâ€™ve ever pondered on the question, "Will AI take over my job?", I've got an answer for you. Why not become the one creating AI tools like Chat GPT that everyone's talking about? It's likely the last job AI will replace. Plus how does a $1 million salary sound to you? OpenAI pays almost this much to its AI engineers. Intrigued? Curious about how to transition into an AI-related job? Read on for a step-by-step guide on building AI tools.

## Decoding the Basics: Human Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence

Just as human intelligence emanates from the transmission of information through neurons, artificial intelligence comes from a network of interconnected nodes called artificial neurons. This network is what we call artificial neural networks or simply, neural networks. And it is the fundamental knowledge you need to comprehend how to build AI tools.

***Building upon this, we must also understand two aspects: deep learning and machine learning.***

## Unraveling Deep Learning and Machine Learning

Deep learning stands under the larger umbrella of machine learning. In deep learning, we utilize a neural network, train it with substantial data, and employ the trained network to predict something. For example, in Chat GPT, the network predicts the next word of a sentence. On the other hand, machine learning is a field where machines acquire the ability to learn.

Nonetheless, before we jump right into constructing neural networks and delving into deep learning, we need to master machine learning. Machine learning stands on three pillars: mathematics, statistics, and programming. Let's navigate through the pillars one by one.

## Mathematics for Machine Learning

Math subjects like linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory form the crux of machine learning. Many online resources offer comprehensive courses to master these concepts.

This specialized course, created by Deep Learning AI, focuses on giving you a head start. If you're someone who would rather not be too involved with the mathematical rigors, the Data Science Math Skills course by Duke University is the right one for you. It's a quick brush through the essential math concepts for machine learning.

## Statistics 101

Once you have a good grip on mathematics, step over to statistics. Statistics is vast, but fortunately, we need only a few core statistics concepts to master machine learning. To get a taste of the basic statistical ideas required for machine learning, there's an excellent course on the list - Introduction to Statistics by Stanford University.

## Python Programming for Machine Learning

"Everything comes back to programming", as they say, and in the machine learning world, everything comes down to Python. Sure, with new languages like Julia emerging on the horizon, it can get quite challenging to pick the right one. However, Python remains the safe choice for now.

The best way to get started with Python is to focus on the basics and build upon it. Resources like [learnpython.org](http://www.learnpython.org/) offer a lot of hands-on exercises to brush up on your Python skills.

## Machine Learning: The Meat and Bones

With mathematics, statistics, and Python under your belt, we're ready to start with actual machine learning. Coursera's **Machine Learning Specialization** by Professor Andrew Ng5 offers extensive training that ensures that you understand machine learning deeply.

Once you've mastered the theory, hands-on practice is essential. Platforms like Kaggle offer an array of machine-learning challenges and project ideas to help you get started. It's time to build your portfolio of projects!

## Deep Diving into Deep Learning

Now that we're confident with machine learning, our original goal of creating AI tools like Chat GPT using neural networks and deep understanding is in sight. To equip ourselves with the necessary deep learning skills, we revisit Professor Andrew Ng5's **Deep Learning Specialization.**

The specialization offers a comprehensive package catering to everything from basics to more advanced concepts. Once completed, you should be armed with all the knowledge to plunge into the AI world.

## Conclusion

Embarking on this journey does take time, but the rewards are worth it. Not only do you open a new career path, but you also ensure you're relevant in the face of rapidly evolving technology.

Sure, machine learning sounds intimidating at first. But remember:

> "Every expert was once a beginner. The key to success is to start before you're ready."

So, don't hesitate, don't wait. Dive in and emerge as the next AI superstar.
