> During all this time, I have tried so many tools of all kinds. Today, I would like to present to you the ones I use daily and that I consider of the highest quality.

## **Hosting and analytics**

### **DigitalOcean**

![DigitalOcean](https://res.cloudinary.com/benjamin-crozat/image/upload/dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_auto/v1667393652/www.digitalocean.com__sctfdo.png align="left")

DigitalOcean has been my cloud hosting provider of choice for more than ten years. I never had any issues, and it works perfectly with Laravel Forge. I also love their top-notch UI and UX.

Their $5/month droplet is what most developers need, so you can start for really cheap (thatâ€™s actually what I use for this blog).

### **Fathom Analytics (a privacy-first alternative to Google Analytics)**

![Fathom Analytics](https://res.cloudinary.com/benjamin-crozat/image/upload/dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_auto/v1667409777/usefathom.com__ubmp2u.png align="left")

Fathom Analytics is a privacy-first and GDPR-compliant analytics tool that can replace Google Analytics. Theyâ€™re using a robust serverless infrastructure that makes it super reliable, even when youâ€™re under a DDoS attack. ðŸ‘Œ

### **Namecheap**

![Namecheap](https://res.cloudinary.com/benjamin-crozat/image/upload/dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_auto/v1689153550/CleanShot_2023-07-12_at_11.18.27_2x_qqadq2.png align="left")

Until fairly recently, I used OVH as a registrar for my domain names. But I changed that for Namecheap. Itâ€™s not a particularly sexy service, but the domains are cheaper (Not that much, but still!), and it does the job well.

Please support my work, [**get your next domain name with Namecheap**](https://www.namecheap.com/) using my affiliate link.

## **Development Software**

### **TablePlus (a native client for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, and more)**

[![TablePlus](https://res.cloudinary.com/benjamin-crozat/image/upload/dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_auto/v1688402983/CleanShot_2023-07-03_at_18.49.07_2x_eskeoc.png align="left")](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/setapp)

Iâ€™m not too fond of phpMyAdmin. It does the job, but itâ€™s from another era, and Iâ€™m done using ugly tools.

Fortunately, TablePlus is exactly what I need. Yes, it costs money, but itâ€™s beautiful and can handle multiple databases (PostgreSQL and Redis, for instance). I definitely recommend it to professional developers.

TablePlus also runs on [**Linux**](https://tableplus.com/linux), [**Windows**](https://tableplus.com/windows), [**iOS**](https://tableplus.com/ios) and [**iPadOS**](https://tableplus.com/ios).)

### **Tower (a beautiful user interface for Git)**

Tower is a beautiful native Mac and Windows user interface for Git. I use it daily because Iâ€™m not masochist enough to force myself to use the CLI tool.

Itâ€™s such an excellent investment, and I canâ€™t even remember when I started using it (probably ten years ago).

[**start your free trial**](https://www.git-tower.com/).

### **Visual Studio Code**

![Visual Studio Code](https://res.cloudinary.com/benjamin-crozat/image/upload/dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_auto/v1688548472/CleanShot_2023-07-05_at_11.13.41_2x_vctwfl.png align="left")

Visual Studio Code is what made me switch from Sublime Text. Itâ€™s fast, powerful, it runs on Mac, Linux, and Windows, has plenty of extensions, and looks nice. Iâ€™m not a PHPStorm guy, so this one is a no-brainer because I can replicate many of the features I need from the popular PHP IDE.

Here are some of the best extensions I use:

* [**GitHub Copilot**](https://github.com/features/copilot/): The popular AI-powered coding assistant. Itâ€™s so useful to generate code and solve complicated problems right in your editor. For now, itâ€™s still limited due to a number of reason, but it can only get better and I canâ€™t wait to see what the future holds.
    
* [**Stripe**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Stripe.vscode-stripe): This extension improves your workflow for testing Stripe-related features in your applications.
    
* [**Tailwind CSS IntelliSense**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss): Just a perfect extension for the popular CSS framework. Itâ€™d be really hard to work without it.

### **ColorSlurp**

ColorSlurp is a beautiful and fun to use color picker that isnâ€™t a browser extension. You can invoke it anytime through a keyboard shortcut. Iâ€™ve been using it for years! And while writing this article, I noticed they now have an iPhone and iPad app.

## **SEO services**

Growing this blog to +10K monthly clicks required a lot of SEO efforts. Here are some of the tools that helped me.

### **Wincher (a rank tracking tool)**

[![Wincher](https://res.cloudinary.com/benjamin-crozat/image/upload/dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_auto/v1688406146/CleanShot_2023-07-03_at_19.41.52_2x_gxersp.png align="left")](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/wincher)

Wincher is by far the best rank tracker Iâ€™ve used. Period.

Itâ€™s pretty expensive, though. Their small tier is way too restrictive for an effective SEO campaign. This is a tool Iâ€™d recommend only to established businesses. In this context, itâ€™s extremely powerful.

## **Other software**

### **Setapp (get tons of apps for cheap)**

[![Setapp](https://res.cloudinary.com/benjamin-crozat/image/upload/dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_auto/v1690881989/CleanShot_2023-08-01_at_11.24.56_2x_hnnw47.png align="left")](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/setapp)

The issue with all these apps is the cost. If you are a professional, thatâ€™s fine, because you should make enough money to pay for them. That being said, reducing cost is always a good thing as long as you donâ€™t compromise quality (in my opinion).

Some of the apps I talked about are available through Setapp. This is a subscription service like Netflix, but for Mac apps. You can see in the image above the ones I installed.

I pay 9.99â‚¬ per month, and itâ€™s totally worth it considering the value I get from the apps I use.

[**Sign up for free**](https://setapp.com/) through my affiliate link, and we both get a free month if you decide to subscribe at the end of your trial!

### **AirBuddy**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691725232224/937ab341-1b7d-499c-afac-b75eea3a262b.avif align="center")

AirBuddy is a great companion to AirPods. I use the last generation of AirPods Pro and I couldnâ€™t do otherwise. Being able to reduce the noise around you in such a tiny package is unbeatable.

AirBuddy add a few features that make using AirPods even more convenient like battery alerts, a widget gathering the battery levels of all your devices, shortcuts for the Shortcuts app, and more.

[**AirBuddy is available through Setapp**](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/setapp), a $9.99 monthly subscription service that lets you install as many apps as you want without paying the full price.

### **Apple Calendar, Mail, Notes, and Reminders**

![Apple Mail](https://res.cloudinary.com/benjamin-crozat/image/upload/dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_auto/v1688405561/CleanShot_2023-07-03_at_19.29.02_2x_uu8jk0.png align="left")

Appleâ€™s default apps are simple, yet powerful. And this is good for me because I donâ€™t like unnecessary complexity. All those apps are obviously installed by default on their devices and synced over iCloud.

### **IA Writer**

![IA Writer](https://res.cloudinary.com/benjamin-crozat/image/upload/dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_auto/v1690526349/CleanShot_2023-07-28_at_08.38.30_2x_mldbod.png align="left")

IA Writer is a delightful Markdown editor with a super simple UI that is a joy to use. What else can I say? Your content is synced between all your devices, which makes it even more convenient to use.

### **Grammarly**

[![Grammarly](https://res.cloudinary.com/benjamin-crozat/image/upload/dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_auto/v1690966175/CleanShot_2023-08-02_at_10.48.51_2x_w6ndjq.png align="left")](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/grammarly)

Iâ€™m not a native English speak. In fact, Iâ€™m French. And more importantly, Iâ€™m human. I make a lot of mistakes when writing, and Grammarly saves my ass all the time.

I use it on my Mac through the Safari extension (Chrome and Firefox are also supported), and even on my iPhone. They have a dedicated keyboard thatâ€™s incredibly helpful.

If you have a content creation business, I canâ€™t recommend it enough.

Please support my work, [**start using Grammarly for free**](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/grammarly) using my affiliate link.

### **Overcast (a podcast player)**

![Overcast](https://res.cloudinary.com/benjamin-crozat/image/upload/dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_auto/v1688478725/CleanShot_2023-07-04_at_15.51.32_2x_zuxgor.png align="left")

When working on repetitive and boring tasks, I like to listen to YouTube videos or podcasts. For the latter, I use Overcast, a free podcast player. I love the UI, the smart features such a voice boost and shortened silences.

[**Check out Overcast**](https://overcast.fm/)

### **Pixelmator Pro (an alternative to Photoshop)**

![Pixelmator Pro](https://res.cloudinary.com/benjamin-crozat/image/upload/dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_auto/v1688478894/CleanShot_2023-07-04_at_15.54.12_2x_fnx528.png align="left")

Pixelmator Pro is a great alternative to Photoshop. Itâ€™s native Mac-only app with a great UI and excellent performances. Itâ€™s perfectly fine for most of my basic usages and itâ€™s a one-time payment instead of a subscription like Photoshop.

[**Check out Pixelmator**](https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/)

### **Safari**

![Safari](https://res.cloudinary.com/benjamin-crozat/image/upload/dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_auto/v1688402337/CleanShot_2023-07-03_at_18.35.59_2x_xldqlb.png align="left")

Safari is my browser of choice. Yeah, I know, most developers use Google Chrome or one of its numerous forks. But I never liked Chrome.

Apple does a way better job than Google in making a real Mac app thatâ€™s battery efficient, doesnâ€™t track you, is fast and beautifully integrated. Also, its dev tools are enough for me and I donâ€™t use many extensions (1Blocker Pro, 1Password, [**Grammarly**](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/grammarly) and Vidimote).

Safari is installed by default on every Mac, iPad and iPhone and I highly recommend it. Donâ€™t follow the crowd!

### **Sketch (an app for designers)**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1691725309930/acfb5d09-335b-4a79-9681-2f4bf2054b4c.avif align="center")

Sketch is a great native Mac app for designers. I donâ€™t consider myself as a designer, but I have some skills in that area. I sometimes use it to create icons, logos, banners, etc.

It looks great, works great, and itâ€™s frequently updated. A must-have in your tool belt.
